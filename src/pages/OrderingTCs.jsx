      <p>
      We prepare all of our food in house - by hand, in our kitchens. 
      Please be aware that all food may contain traces of allergens.
      </p>
      <p>
      When selecting delivery time slots, please allow plenty of time for your order as we are at the mercy of traffic which can be unpredictable.
      We will attempt delivery of your order only once. If no one is available to receive it, the order will be taken back to our bakery. 
      You can still collect the food at the bakery, before closing time. 
      </p>
      <p>
      If the food has been out for a long period of time, some items may no longer be safe for consumption. 
      In such instances, we cannot provide a refund. Any uncollected orders will be donated to our charity partner at the end of day.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you wish to add special instructions for our bakery or couriers, 
      you can do so up until 11am 2 working days before by contacting us via our contact page.
